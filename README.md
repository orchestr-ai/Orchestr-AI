## Challenges we ran into
Keeping the entire flow autonomous - It took a lot of discussion and brainstorming to come up with a flow that made sense especially after trying and accomodating mentors feedback
Deploying multiple agents - The project involved multiple AI agents, Backend and Frontend each of which needed to be deployed. We came through and deployed all of these on multiple platforms (Vercel and Railway)
Post feedback the scope seemed to suddenly increase and become overwhelming we as a team helped each other in narrowing down the scope and provide a working MVP in a small time frame.
